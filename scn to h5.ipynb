The folder-hierarchy will be recreated in the \"scn.h5\" file at the top level, while the scan files will become labeled tables in the new h5 file. I haven't tested this, but I'm pretty sure that if you moved that file around between folders with this script it will append all the new data.\n",

      "- Ray time (represent as 64 bit unix time or 16-bit milliseconds since the hour)\n",
      "    - note that the hour is represented in the group structure, although I'm unsure of how to pull it out\n",
      "- azimuth (16 bit integer or 32 bit float to allow fractional degrees)\n",
      "- elevation (as azimuth)\n",
      "- pitch (16 bit fixed-point with no loss of accuracy or 32-bit float)\n",
      "- roll (as pitch)\n",
